# Bayes-talk-2017
Here you can find all materials related to the Bayes talk in PyCon Sweden.
matches.csv contains input data
upcoming.cvs contains the prediction data
predicted_table is the summary of the results
In PPT, you can also find a lot of notes to help to have a better understanding. 
PPC (posterior prediction check) is also mentioned briefly in the PPT. 
(I didn't have time to go through this part in the talk. But PPC is quite important)
This is still the initial commit, should make the code more beautiful when I have time. :)
(My husband just said you'll never have time while he's watching cat's video. LOL )
